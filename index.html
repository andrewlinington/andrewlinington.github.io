                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Andrew Linington. I am a third year Software Engineering Student with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Guelph. This page will give you the details of my employment with CIBC in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
                   I plan to convey how through my work I was able to succeed in a remote work-term environment with CIBC.

                <h2>
                    Employer Information
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CIBC is a Canadian company that was founded in 1867 as  Canadian Bank of Commerce later known as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
                    They are a Bank that has many branches located across America, Europe and Asia with a focus in Canadian Banking with over eleven million clients.
                    My team, LiveLabs, is the Innovation & Digital Technology Lab of CIBC which developed technology and new improvements to existing technology for our clients.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Job Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                   During my 4 months at CIBC, I was a software engineer working on a Fullstack Project with some DevOps deployment work on top.
                    In the DevOps portion of my Job I got the opportunity to work with a variety of different technologies like AWS, Microsoft AppCenter, GitLab CI (YML files, DockerFiles)
                    which I utilized to be able to run and test the project for any tests failing or merge conflict errors being caught.
                    Other then DevOPS I was responsible for developing and building an app with a backend in an Agile environment using Test Driven Development with pair programming to develop and test the applications as we went.
                    During creation of the backend the team and I were focused on making sure we could host and run the backend securely and make sure we could access S3, DynamoDB and FireBase for notifications.
                    For the Android App we were responsible for developing with a focus in clean and fluid design where we were asked to implement existing Figma designs and Lottie animations for the screens.
                    When it Came to Testing the App we Were responsible to use RoboElectric, Mockito and other testing resources in Android to ensure the UI and RESTful API calls were properly working.
                    For iOS  it was fairly similar to Android with regard to what I was responsible for with the difference being in how testing was performed (XCTest, UIKit testing) and how certain problems had to be attacked.
                    The Main difference being that mocking required us to create our own mocks of our existing calls to prevent calls to our backend and other libraries that might have needed to make calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Over the course of my Semester at CIBC I was given the opportunity to work with a noSQL database (DynamoDB) and manage the data from a backend.
                            While working with the database I wanted to become better at managing how data is stored as while developing a product existing data for the database may change over time as development criteria change.
                            My goal was to make sure to improve my practice of dealing with the database to keep the database clear of data that conflicts with new criteria or develop the database to allow for expansion of existing table dat without conflicts.
                            During the period when I was working with the database I was able able to meet my goals through maintaining a routine clean up of the sever by making standard test data and
                            also making sure that data is formatted properly such that any new changes to the database do not cause the data to break existing code on the backend and front end.
                            Overall I belive I made great strides into learning how to manage and maintain a server which is what I was hoping for.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            At CIBC LiveLabs my team was Agile and as such we had many of the Agile practices to take a part of each and every day,
                            which was significantly different from what id been exposed to at the time so I wanted to get to better learn and participate properly in them.
                            So in order to achieve my goal I aimed to maintain the trello board and participate more in IPM meetings, Daily stand ups, Retros  and Demos.
                            over the course of the remainder of the semester after setting out to complete this goal I ended up completing significantly more Trello tickets and created more as necessary changes arose.
                            In addition to the changes to the trello boards I took the opportunity to involve myself greater in Agile ceremonies like demos and retros where I would share the state of the project with my team.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Finally my last goal for my work term with CIBC was to gain some overall exposure to iOS and Swift, a language and system I had never had the opportunity to work with it before.
                            My focus with working in iOS development was to learn more about the tools and how to implement the Figma designs to which required a deeper understanding of the storyboard and some exposure to development tools.
                            Over the course of this work term I was extremely happy to learn how to work with XCode, as painful as it can be to work with at times, through picking up numerous more tickets involving iOS development on the team.
                            While learning Swift I was exposed new tools for testing and wanted to ensure they were used effectively so I migrated existing mocks to references to exiting code as opposed to copy pasted code with no calls to the backend.
                            While developing for iOS I was able to expose myself to working with stroyboard and learn how to move between screens in numerous ways the rest of my team had not used before and helped to simplify existing designs we had implemented.
                            Although I was able to learn a lot the work for developing the app was not completely finished in my term but was left in a decent place for future development.

                <h2>
                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                   Overall this semester was very successful for learning new technologies and expanding my knowledge of languages I've worked on before and learning new content which helped to increase my exposure to new languages.

                   This semester was a huge chance to learn a lot about technologies in the industry and expand my knowledge and scope when it came to working outside a school environment and helped me to gain confidence
                    in my skills while working at school.
